# Inframove

A Leap Motionâ„¢-driven robotic hand.

## Introduction

A friend of mine and I started this project out of boredom.

When we started working on this project there were some projects online that implemented a basic hand manipulation system, but we got disappointed as they did not manage wrist rotation properly.

## Algorithm

The algorithm is a simple application of reversed Gram-Schmidt process to find an orthogonal set in a vector space.

The idea is to use the vector finger bones and palm normal
